## Conflict Plan

What will be our groups process to resolve conflict when it arises?

Prior to working on our project, we will have a quick 5-10 minute meeting to discuss any issues that we may be having to resolve them before they become too problematic. We will ensure that each member of the team is able to voice their ideas/concerns and we will address them promptly.

## Communication Plan

We will be utilizing slack and remo to communicate the majority of the time. We are going to schedule time outside of regular class hours to work on our project to ensure that we do not fall behind and complete it in a timely manner.

## Work Plan

We are going to start by building a wireframe. Next, we will identify the tasks associated with the functionality of our project. Once the tasks are identified, we will divy them up amongst one another and we will assign a lead person to particular tasks. We will be looking into using Asana to manage workflow.

## Git Process

We will be adding contributors to our repository. We will review each PR amongst each other prior to merging to our main branch. We will contact one another via slack whenever we are ready to create a PR.
